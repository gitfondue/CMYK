    <p class="ask">What is CMYK?</p>

    <p>CMYK (Coloring Makes You Kalm) is a database of various coloring pages that can resemble different moods and expressions a person can have. The name is a reference to the color model CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, key/black) used in color printing.</p>

    <p class="ask">How does CMYK work?</p>

    <p>People can pick from our search query coloring pages they feel fit their current emotions and complexity. These pictures can be printed out or downloaded locally. People may also sign up as users and share a gallery of their completed art, or even contribute their own drawings to the database that may help others.</p>

    <p class="ask">What is CMYK's Purpose?</p>

    <p>We provided this coloring page database as a means for people to have easy access to somewhere they can express and vent their emotions: through destressing by coloring. Many people of all ages still have trouble finding somewhere or an activity to follow to destress, which can result in many mental health problems like high stress or insomnia. We want to reach out to these people through artistic expression and quick online access and hope they can find a equilibrium with their feelings amd emotions.

    We also opened the option to upload pictures to our website as a way to let people help each other in destressing and support each other through rough times.</p>
