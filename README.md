# CMYK (Coloring Makes You "K"alm)

A database website of various designs and pages meant to color for relieving stress, venting, or just happily coloring. Users can use a search query to bring up a set of coloring pages and pick which pages they'd like to use. Users may color online, digitally via downloading, or print out pages.

Users may also have accounts to share their colored pages or upload their own pages to add to the database.
